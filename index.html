  </div>
  <div class="text">
    <p>This open-faced cheese pie is the version of khachapuri that's the most responsible for 
      putting khachapuri on the map. It is made with yeasted dough which is shaped into an oblong and then 
      filled with a mixture of Imeratian and sulguni cheese, and to which some milk is often added as well
      to help achieve the right consistency. The assembled khachapuri is shortly baked in the hot oven, and 
      a couple of minutes before it's done, an egg is plopped on top of the cheese. The pie is then returned 
      to the oven, so the egg partially bakes. Adjarian khachapuri is served straight out of the oven 
      with a pat of butter on top which is to be mixed into the filling before eating.</p>

    <h2>Cooking Tips</h2>

<div class="method">
  <h3>Method</h3>
</div>
<div class="recipe">
  <p>There are two ways you can shape the bread. One way is to shape the dough
     into a "boat" first and then fill it with cheese, and the other way is first to 
     \spread the rolled out dough with cheese and then shape it into a boat, which will make
      for a cheese-filled outer rim. Another trick that's often used is to add grated cheese to 
      the ends of the bread before they are sealed together as that will provide more crunch and 
      texture when baked.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="Cheese">
    <h3>Cheese</h3>
  <div class="Cheese1">
    <p>Since Georgian cheese will probably not be readily available in most countries 
      besides Georgia, using mozzarella and feta in equal amounts is the next best thing as it will 
      produce similar results as using Imeratian and sulguni cheese.</p>
  </div>
<div class="Eating">
  <h3>Eating</h3>
</div>
<div class="Eating1">
<p>Eating with a fork and knife is perfectly okay, but if you'd 
  like the full experience, eat it the way they do it in Georgia. 
  So, when khachapuri comes to the table, you first mix the egg 
  and the butter into the cheese using a fork. Then, you tear the
   pieces of the bread and dunk them into the cheese first before 
   you pop them into your mouth.</p>
